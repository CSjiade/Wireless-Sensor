**Background:** Purpose of project is embedded software development where we implement proximity detection and seperation between two CC2650 sensortags <br/>
**Tools used** 
C, Contiki OS and Cooja, CC2650 SensorTag and UniFlash <br/>
**** <br/>

**Specific requirements:**
1. Discover pair of devices with contact times of 15s or more with high probability
2. Estimate the total duration in which two nodes are in proximity
3. Discover that a node in proximity has moved away for 30s or more with high probability
4. Reduce power consumption as much as possible
